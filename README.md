# Form Sentinel
Form Sentinel allows you to validate the forms on your page fast and painless. Just describe validation constraints that you wish your form
to correspond to, specify when a validation should happen (or even when and which ones on which fields should happen), then add the
validation event listener to your form and handle results!

## Installation
Currently there are **two** possible ways to install Form Sentinel:

1. Just download the version you prefer and add it to your project folder
1. Install via `bower`
    ```shell
    $ bower install form-sentinel
