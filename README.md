# Form Sentinel
Form Sentinel allows you to validate the forms on your page fast and painless. Just describe validation constraints that you wish your form
to correspond to, specify when a validation should happen (or even when and which ones on which fields should happen), then add the
validation event listener to your form and handle results!
